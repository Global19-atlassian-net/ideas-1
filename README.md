# The Idea List

* Build an Apache Hive browser panel extension for JupyterLab that lets users drill-down to see see available databases, tables, and columns. Maybe make it generic to support any relational datastore, not just Hive. ([@parente](https://twitter.com/parente))
* Create a linter for notebook files. Accordingly, define a PEP-8 equivalent for notebooks. ([@betatim](https://twitter.com/betatim))
* Create a binder-bot that identifies popular notebook repositories on GitHub that are not Binder enabled, divines their requirements, and submits best-effort pull requests to Binder enable them. Needs careful design to balance convenience and annoyance. ([@parente](https://twitter.com/parente))
* Idea to enhance nbviewer with js/css plugins to make nbviewer+ipynb more secure (as GitHub), dynamic and mobile friendly ([nbviewer/issues/778](https://github.com/jupyter/nbviewer/issues/778)).
