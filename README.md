# jupyter/ideas

Do you have an idea for a new Jupyter project? Are you looking to connect with other community members who might have a similar interest and want to collaborate? Do you have time to share your thoughts but not necessarily bring them to fruition at the moment? Would you like to offer fodder for people to work on during a community sprint?

Follow the steps below to share or update an idea here!

## Instructions

1. Click the README.md file in this repository.
2. Click the pencil icon in the top right of the file view.
3. Scroll to *The Idea List*.
4. To post a new idea, add a bullet (\*) followed by one to two brief sentences describing the idea and (optionally) your contact information (e.g., if you're planning to work on the idea and would like people with the same interest to reach out).
5. To show that an idea is being worked on somewhere, add a link to the existing idea bullet.
6. To remove ideas no longer worth listing, delete the bullet.

## The Idea List

* Build an Apache Hive browser panel extension for JupyterLab that lets users drill-down to see see available databases, tables, and columns. Maybe make it generic to support any relational datastore, not just Hive. ([@parente](https://twitter.com/parente))
* Create a linter for notebook files. Accordingly, define a PEP-8 equivalent for notebooks. ([@betatim](https://twitter.com/betatim))
